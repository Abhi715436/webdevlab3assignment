## 📌 Project Overview  
This is my Lab Assignment 3 for Web Development.  
I created a **one-page responsive portfolio website** using:

- Flexbox  
- CSS Grid  
- Media Queries  
- Animations  
- Hover Effects  
- Relative CSS Units (rem, %, vw, vh)

The website has sections like **Header, Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Contact, and Footer**.  
I tried to keep the design simple and clean because I am still learning web development.
